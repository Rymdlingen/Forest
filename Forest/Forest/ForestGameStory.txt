Just like after every winter sleep you wake up from dreams about a different life, you dreamt about flying like a bird, about living under water like a fish, about being tiny like a mouse. Every spring you wake up from exciting fantasies about being all different animals you can imagine, 'what could a bear do to change its life?' you wonder.\nIt's the same story every year, you prepare your den for next winter and you eat and eat and eat, everything is just preparing for next winter sleep. 'Could this year be different?'- Intro story with description of the forest, its located on a big cliff on a mountainside,

"A long, long time ago it was easy for all animals to travel between this part of the forest, up on the cliff, and the lower parts of the forest. That was before the big landslide happened, it made the cliffs steeper and formed the dam on the edge of the rocky cliffs. The landslide took most of the forest on the cliff with it, all trees were shoveled by the big rocks that came tumbling down the mountain side, all trees except for the big old tree. That was so long ago that the forest we live in is already old again" that's how GrandBear always used to start all the stories about the old forest on the cliffs.

"When the landslide brought down the rocks from the mountain side it did not only take the trees away, it also made a mystery out of the Shape Shifters. The old rumors say that before the landslide this forest was full of all kinds of animals, and not only that, many animals could change their form into whatever animal they wanted, or needed, to be. It was thrilling to see their tricks when they were playing and chasing each other all over the forest, shifting form at any moment. Their powers came from beautiful jewelry generously adorned with lots of big yellow gemstones, they had all different kinds of jewelry, bracelets, armlets, rings, necklaces, pendants, medallions, even crowns, tiaras and bejeweled hats!"

"The source of the stones magic was said to come from a mysterious sorcerer who was living in a small cottage at the north edge of the forest, closest to the mountain. After the landslide there was no signs of there ever being anything but rocks. There was rumors about the sorcerer fleeing along with all the shape shifting animals down the mountain, scattering all over the valley below the now very steep cliffs. None of them were ever seen again, not even after the forest started to regrow. All that is left of those magical times is the big old tree, the rumors about where everyone went and the old stories told through years and years. And the Bears of course, not ever did a Bear master the magic of the shape shifter stones, when the landslide hit they couldn't shift shape and easily get away. Instead they took cover in their dens..."
