Name: Forest
Description: This part of the forest is dense, dark and mostly consists of old, tall spruce trees. On the ground there is some dark green moss but mostly the ground is covered by big old logs and sticks fallen from the old trees. Almost all around you the trees grow so closely together that you never go there, but to the south there is a small path between two tall spruces and the path back towards the den is to the west.

ID: 5MossyForestSouth
Name: Forest
Description: There is a small clearing between some smaller spruces, the sun almost makes it all the way to the ground that is covered with soft, dark green moss, this is one of the best spots for a nap in the whole forest. To the north is a small path between some of the tallest trees and to the northwest is a path back to your den (which also is a great place for a nap), but in all other directions the forest is so dense that it's simply to much of an effort to try to squeeze through between the tree trunks.

Name: Glade
Description: You are standing in the middle of a glade, a green grassy meadow with flowers and honey bees everywhere. Being here with the spring sun warming your fur makes you feel like taking a break in the long soft grass, but the hardworking bees flying back and forth between the forest to the east and the flowers on the meadow reminds you of the hard work you have in front of you to prepare for next winter sleep. Your den is to the south of here.

Many times have you heard the old stories about how bees used to live all over the forest, making the forest full of flowers and fruits almost all year long, all because of their hard work with pollinating. The few bees that are left are still working hard, they are not giving up! They tirelessly fly back and forth from the glade in the west and their beehives.

Name: Leafy forest
Description: You are surrounded by birch trees, they are a bit bigger in this area. Their leaves are green and small, the lowest branches are just out of your reach. Between the trees small streams of water is rippling down towards the river and most of the ground is covered in long sticks and the leaves that fell from the trees last year. For as long as you can see this kind of forest continues around you. "Probably nothing more to see" you think, the way back is to the south.

Description: You are in the light green and bright birch forest, the trees here are young and pretty small compared to the trees in the old forest. The light green leaves on the birches are pretty big but they still look soft and pretty cozy. Between the trees water is rippling down from the forest in the north towards the river further through the forest to the south. The path to the east leads back towards your den.

ID: 13LeafyForestSouth
Name: Leafy forest
Description: It seems like the small leaves of the young birches are especially soft in this part of the forest, the sun is shining through the small leaves in the light green canopy and the sound from the rippling water makes this a perfect spot for midday naps. The streams of water that are coming from the mountains through the forest in the north are gathering to a bigger stream, they create a waterslide down to the river in the south.

ID: 15SouthEastForest
Name: Forest
Description: Here the forest is lush and warm, the birds are singing and some warm rays of sunlight makes it through the dense canopy. This is where the oldest tree in the whole forest is, in all the old stories you heard as a small cub this tree was already old, it seems like it has been here through all time. "If only the tree could tell the stories" you think for yourself. \nYour den is not far to the northwest of the old tree, you made sure to live nearby so you can go here to wind down and think about the curious old stories whenever you want.

ID: 16WestRiver
Name: River
Description: This is where the river connect with the water that is streaming down from the mountains, the water here has strong currents and the river forcefully flows to the east where it eventually calms down in a natural dam before continuing down the cliffs.

ID: 17EastRiver
Name: River
Description: The long river flows in from the west and takes a break in a small natural dam, the old stories say that the dam was created by a huge landslide long before the forest grew old, even in those stories the old tree was old and stod tall through the landslide. There is lots of fish in the water and this is a perfect place for a swim. On most sides around the dam there is big rocks containing the water, only in the east the water finds its way through and around the rocks to continue down the cliffs. On the north side of the dam is the old forest and a path that leads back to your den.

ID: 18Waterfall
Name: Waterfall
Description: The water coming from the natural dam in the west creates a waterfall that forcefully flows down the cliffs, it's beautiful and dangerous. As a part of the view point to the northeast there is a fence to keep visitors safe. At this part of the view point there is some old, once considered high tech binoculars that can give a closer look at the view.

ID: 19ViewPoint
Name: View point
Description: This is a popular viewpoint where the humans like to come for picnics and watching the magnificent view over the big forest below the cliffs and the far away rocky mountains. In the summer it is fun to hide nearby and watch what they do. Since it is the beginning of spring they rarely come here and it's safe to take a look at the view and search through the left behind picnics, the trash cans and around the tables to see if there is something useful just lying around. The view point is fenced off towards the cliff and follows the edge towards the waterfall in the southwest.
Directions:
    Southwest: 18Waterfall

ID: 20Cliffs
Name: Cliffs
Description: You swam across the river and you are standing on the top of high, steep cliffs. The cliffs stretch to the sides for as long as you can see. The view is even better here compared to the view point, at the foot of the cliffs the forest continues, far in the southwest you can see snow and in the far southeast there is big mountains. The only way down is a narrow and steep path. "If only I was a tiny animal, like a little mouse, or maybe a bird.. then I could easily make my way down the cliff. I wonder what it's like down there.." bear thinks. It's not a path fit for a bear. The only way from here that works for a bear is swimming back north over the river, back to the old forest.
