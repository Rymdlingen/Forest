0You slide down the stream of water into the river, on the south side of the river there is mostly big rocks, but also a passage that you can go through to get a great view from the high cliffs. But the currents are strong here so they take you further down the river to the natural dam in the east.

1You can't climb up through the streaming water that is flowing down through the forest from the mountains, the rocks are too slippery. You will have to find another way around.

2Your den needs to be prepared for next winter sleep. You should clean it out and make it cozy with soft green materials found in the forest.

3Your den needs to be prepared for next winter sleep. It is cleaned but you should also make it cozy with soft green materials found in the forest.

4Your den is very cozy with soft moss, grass and leaves.

5There is no such thing that you can pick up here.

6You should clean the den before putting anything in there. A good spring cleaning always makes your home feel cozier!

7You already have @.

8You added the @ on top of your pile of @.

9In your pile of leaves you now have @ at the bottom, then @ and some @ on top. You can't possibly carry more leaves.

10You are carrying a bunch of @.

11In the pile of leaves you have @ with @ on top.

12In your pile of leaves you have @ at the bottom, then @ and some @ on top. You can't possibly carry more leaves.

13You don't have a pile of leaves to look at.

14You make it back to the den with most of your pile of leaves still with you, the old, heavier leaves on the top stayed on the pile for quite some time but eventually the flew away, most of the big leaves were also caught by the wind but you are still carrying all of the soft, light green leaves since they were at the bottom of the pile!

15Your den is clean and you have added @ to start to make it cozy, I'm sure there is something else that could be added to make the den even cozier.

16Your den is starting to feel really cozy, it is clean and there is @ and @ that makes the floor soft and warm. But there is still that little extra missing.

17Your den is probably the coziest in the whole forest! All the moss, leaves and grass must be the softest the forest has to offer, you just have to try it out right away! 

18Zzzzz....

19Zzzzzzzz....

20Zzz...

21That was great, best den ever!

22Your den is clean but it needs something to make it cozy.

23You clean out all the old foliage and your den is now looking pretty good, it's time to gather new material for making it cozy for next winter.

24doesn't need cleaning.

25Your den is clean and the floor is covered in soft moss, grass and leaves, it's the coziest den you have ever made!

26Can't do that.

27uh oh.. sliding down the river and carrying leaves don't go well together, all your leaves flew away in the wind.

28There is nothing of interest in that direction.

29The soft leaves on the top of the pile flew away immediately, they are the most important for a cozy den. Better try again!

30You make it back to the den with most of the leaves, only the big leaves on the top of the pile flew away in the wind. But this mix of old leaves and soft leaves is not perfect.. you can do better! You let the rest of the leaves fly away in the wind, let's try again!

31You make it back to the den with only the old leaves left, that's not going to be good enough! You get rid of the old leaves.

32As soon as the old leaves flew away so did the soft leaves, can't have a cozy den without soft leaves. You trow the big leaves in the wind and watch them fly away.

33You lost a lot of leaves on the windy walk back to the den, now you don't have enough to make the den cozy. You could probably carry more from the start, don't give up!

34The few leaves you had was blown away in the wind, luckily there is a lot more where that came from. Leaves are important for making the den cozy, let's try again!

35You are carrying a pile of leaves on the windy path back to the den, the wind gets stronger and start blowing your leaves away.

36You don't have that, so you can't drop it.

37What do you want to search through?

38What do you want to do?

39What you are trying to search through is not here.

40You didn't find anything.

41You found more trash, you have @ pieces of trash now.

42You got rid of all the trash you had.

43There is nothing you want to search through.

44That doesn't need cleaning.

45What needs cleaning?

46There is no such thing to look at.

47You do not see @ here.

48You are not carrying anything.

49You are carrying these things: 

50 and 

51You are carrying a whole bunch of trash, @ pieces to be exact.

52There is trash on the ground, who put that there?

53There is also trash on the ground, who put that there?

54There is trash both on the ground around the tables and picnic blankets and in the overflowing trash cans, the humans are always leaving such a mess behind.

55There is also trash both on the ground around the tables and picnic blankets and in the overflowing trash cans, the humans are always leaving such a mess behind.

56You are carrying some trash.

57You read the instructions on the binoculars, it says: \n"*View Magnifier 3000*\nVery high tech (possibly a bit over engineered) binoculars, offering you the best close ups of your breathtaking, scenic view (view not included).\nUse the buttons with arrows (in the bottom right corner of the view magnifier) to adjust the direction of the binoculars to your liking.\nEnjoy your increased vision, you are welcome!"\nThe binoculars look old and they are probably not so very high tech as they ones were, but most of the time they work just fine.

58When you push the button the binoculars rotate a tiny bit to the left.

59The binoculars rotate to the right, a lot! Seems to be a sensitive button.

60The binoculars tilt slightly up when you press the button, but after a few seconds they drop down again.

61A quick and big tilt down. "I'm not sure it is supposed to work like this" you think to yourself.

62Where do you want to look?

63The binoculars beeps and from its speaker you hear "Invalid input, shutting down". Better read the instructions if you want to try again.

64You hear a crackle from the binoculars speaker followed by a message "You have reached the limit for free inputs, please add more coins". You don't have any coins, but that doesn't matter, the coin input is broken and next time you will get new free inputs anyway.

65The binoculars are looking north towards the forest and in the short seconds that they stay tilted a bit up you see something between the tree trunks.

66The binoculars are looking north, where the hidden path is!

67Old rumors say that there is a way to get to the old tree from here, you have spent a lot of time looking for it, but it's said that only those who know where it is can find it.

68"What did I see in the north?" you wonder.

69To the north there is a hidden path that you can only find if you know where it is, you know where it is, it's to the north.

70There is a small, almost hidden, path to the south, if you follow it you will end up by the waterfall, close to the view point.

71You have found a hidden path!

72You stroll along the winding path, the forest around you gets lusher and warmer, this must be the hidden path to the old tree!

73You almost stepped on something pointy that is hiding in the leaves on the ground..

74You pick it up, it is a sharp, rusty, not straight nail. "Lucky I didn't step on it!" you think. Better bring it with you, it's dangerous to have it hidden in the middle of a path like that.

75You stroll on and eventually you arrive at the old tree.

76There is two different sticks, an old one and a long one, which one?

77I don't understand.

78Hmmm.. A rope, a nail and a stick, you can make something useful out of these things.

79You start with combining the rope and the rusty nail, "PERFECT!" you shout excitedly, "It's exactly like a fikshingline with a hook!".

80You combine the line with a hook with the @, you have made a fishing rod!

81You find a nice spot on a rock, you sit down with the fishing rod that you made out of the @.

82Now you just wait..

83..and wait..

84..wait some more..

85..wait..

86Bear sighs and think "This is ridiculous! I bet it would be quicker to lay in the water with your mouth wide open and wait for the fish to swim in there".

87You can see that there are some fish starting to gather around your hook, exciting!

88One of the fishes gives the hook a small nibble, it looks like a big one!

89It bites!!

90It's strong, but you are stronger! You start pulling with all you strength to get the fish out of the water.

91SNAP!

92The fishing rod breaks in two and the fish quickly swims away.. seems like the old stick couldn't handle the pressure.

93Trying to catch fish like the humans do it didn't work out, at all. Why do it like a human when it's so easy to just catch it with your paw? Bear walks over to the view point and throws the fishing rod in a trash can. Then Bear goes back to the dam, gets into the water and effortlessly catches a fish.\n"Thats how it's done!"

94You are carrying the stick.

95The stick is on the ground.

96There is no good spots for fishing here.

97You take a good look at the fish. Usually you would catch the fish with your paw, but you have seen the humans catch fish in a different way, they use a stick with a line and a hook and then they throw the hook in the water and wait for the fish to come to them and get caught on the hook.

98An idea pops up in your head "I want to try to catch fish like a human does it!". So no catching fish with you paws for now, instead you need to find a way to do it like a human.

99There is a lot of big fishes swimming in the calm and warm water of the natural dam.\nYou are trying to catch a fish like the humans do it! You need to find a way to make something similar to the rod they use.

100You are trying to catch a fish like the humans do it, so you can't just catch it with your paw like you usually do. You need to find a way to make something similar to the rod the humans use.
