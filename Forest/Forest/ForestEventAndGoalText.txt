0You slide down the stream of water into the river, on the south side of the river there is mostly big rocks, but also a passage that you can go through to get a great view from the high cliffs. But the currents are strong here so they take you further down the river to the natural dam in the east.

1You can't climb up through the streaming water that is flowing down through the forest from the mountains, the rocks are too slippery. You will have to find another way around.

2Your den needs to be prepared for next winter sleep. You should clean it out and make it cozy with soft green materials found in the forest.

3Your den needs to be prepared for next winter sleep. It is cleaned but you should also make it cozy with soft green materials found in the forest.

4Your den is very cozy with soft moss, grass and leaves.

5There is no such thing that you can pick up here.

6You should clean the den before putting anything in there. A good spring cleaning always makes your home feel cozier!

7You already have @.

8You added the @ on top of your pile of @.

9In your pile of leaves you now have @ at the bottom, then @ and some @ on top. You can't possibly carry more leaves.

10You are carrying a bunch of @.

11In the pile of leaves you have @ with @ on top.

12In your pile of leaves you have @ at the bottom, then @ and some @ on top. You can't possibly carry more leaves.

13You don't have a pile of leaves to look at.

14You make it back to the den with most of your pile of leaves still with you, the old, heavier leaves on the top stayed on the pile for quite some time but eventually the flew away, most of the big leaves were also caught by the wind but you are still carrying all of the soft, light green leaves since they were at the bottom of the pile!

15Your den is clean and you have added @ to start to make it cozy, I'm sure there is something else that could be added to make the den even cozier.

16Your den is starting to feel really cozy, it is clean and there is @ and @ that makes the floor soft and warm. But there is still that little extra missing.

17Your den is probably the coziest in the whole forest! All the moss, leaves and grass must be the softest the forest has to offer, you just have to try it out right away! 

18Zzzzz....

19Zzzzzzzz....

20Zzz...

21That was great, best den ever!

22Your den is clean but it needs something to make it cozy.

23You clean out all the old foliage and your den is now looking pretty good, it's time to gather new material for making it cozy for next winter.

24doesn't need cleaning.

25Your den is clean and the floor is covered in soft moss, grass and leaves, it's the coziest den you have ever made!

26Can't do that.

27uh oh.. sliding down the river and carrying leaves don't go well together, all your leaves flew away in the wind.

28There is nothing of interest in that direction.

29The soft leaves on the top of the pile flew away immediately, they are the most important for a cozy den. Better try again!

30You make it back to the den with most of the leaves, only the big leaves on the top of the pile flew away in the wind. But this mix of old leaves and soft leaves is not perfect.. you can do better! You let the rest of the leaves fly away in the wind, let's try again!

31You make it back to the den with only the old leaves left, that's not going to be good enough! You get rid of the old leaves.

32As soon as the old leaves flew away so did the soft leaves, can't have a cozy den without soft leaves. You trow the big leaves in the wind and watch them fly away.

33You lost a lot of leaves on the windy walk back to the den, now you don't have enough to make the den cozy. You could probably carry more from the start, don't give up!

34The few leaves you had was blown away in the wind, luckily there is a lot more where that came from. Leaves are important for making the den cozy, let's try again!

35You are carrying a pile of leaves on the windy path back to the den, the wind gets stronger and start blowing your leaves away.

36You don't have that, so you can't drop it.

37What do you want to search through?

38What do you want to do?

39What you are trying to search through is not here.

40You didn't find anything.

41You found more trash, you have @ pieces of trash now.

42You have got rid of all the trash you had.

43There is nothing you want to search through.
