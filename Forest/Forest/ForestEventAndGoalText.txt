16Your den is starting to feel really cozy, it is clean and there is @ and @ that makes the floor soft and warm. But there is still that little extra missing.

17Your den is probably the coziest in the whole forest! All the moss, leaves and grass must be the softest the forest has to offer, you just have to try it out right away!
